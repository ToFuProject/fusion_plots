# Fusion plots
Plots and figures relevant for a fusion research lecture.

This repository consists of plots I made for a lecture "Fusion Research" (which I give at the University of Stuttgart), for the LATINfusion 2019 event, and for various outreach activities. Most of the plots can be found in some text books but either their formatting style did not agree with mine or they required some updates to account for recent developments.

The source code for producing the plots should contain references to the original publication or data where available. 

A reference to the released package, see the doi, would be nice and is greatly appreciated. The doi is 10.5281/zenodo.4946068, which should link to the latest release of the package and it also points to this repository, so referencing this doi makes most sense.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or requests.
